MVP for Tech Recruiting Portal App set up to be deployed via heroku

known issues: 

* flask version may have a security vulnerabilility 
* email address used for registration confirmation no longer exists
* if running locally, you're going to need to spin up a postgres instance (probably should use docker for that) and map port 5432 to 1702
