## what am I looking at? 
--

If you're here it's probably because you've been talking to a recruiter and you said 'yes' when they asked if you wanted to see what jobs they are currently sourcing for. welcome! 

This view will show you what a recruiter currently as to offer. You will be shown job recs, one at a time, until you've exhausted what the recruiter currently has to offer. While the recruiter knows who you are and what *of theirs* you have looked at, to the rest of the universe you are totally anonymous. Recruiters get new job recs all the time so even if you've exhausted the supply of what they've got now, you can check back later and see what's new. 

Below the job rec you'll see four buttons. Let's go through them left to right: 

* The one on the lower left with the question mark (the one you clicked to see this view) is the help button. 

* The light blue button with the dialogue balloon is the 'Comment' button. It allows you to submit a comment about the rec. You aren't required to do so, but if you do, hashtags are allowed.

* The dark blue button with the tag is the 'Sentiment' button. It allows you to mark what you see as something you're into, not into, surprised by, confused by, or meh about. As with the commenting, you aren't required to do anything if you're not feeling it. 

* Last but not least we have the green 'Next' button. Click this and you'll be taken to the next job rec in the series. 

That's about it! If there are any questions or comments or you're just bored feel free to reach out to either me (hi I'm David!) or Amanda at david@wildduck.io or amanda@wildduck.io, respectively. 

cheers!
